# Commits
The commit format is as follows - Firstname: commit message. Very simple!

# Components
For the time being, while we are learning about components, we will be keeping them self-contained. I made a simple example in the "Main" folder. Notice how the CSS file and html file are self-contained (except for the logo). Keep things this way until otherwise mentioned!
